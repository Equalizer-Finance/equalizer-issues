<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-request), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use [Discord](https://discord.equalizer.finance)).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* Pull request will be allowed after we confirm your bug.  

<!-- Bug reports -->
## Bug reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

Guidelines for bug reports:

   * Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.

   * Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.

   * Isolate the problem — create a reduced test case and a live example.

<!-- Pull request -->
## Pull request

Good pull requests - patches, improvements - are a fantastic help! They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.
Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.
Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).
